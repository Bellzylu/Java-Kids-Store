# 🎈 **Kids Store in Java** 🎈

This project is a basic implementation of a kids store written purely in Java. It's designed to be as straightforward and user-friendly as possible. Originally crafted as a school project, I've decided to share it with the world to help others learn Java in the simplest form. 📚

## **Features** 🎪

* **Simple Data** Storage: Data is temporarily stored, and there is no actual database.
* **MVC Architecture**: Organized in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure.
* **Terminal-based UI**: Run the project in your terminal and navigate through the store.
* **Pure Java**: No complex frameworks or libraries, just plain old Java to keep things simple.
