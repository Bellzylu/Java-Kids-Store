🎈 Kids Store in Java 🎈
Welcome to the Kids Store project! This is a simple, playful, and easy-to-understand Java application, perfect for those who are just diving into the world of Java and want to see it in action. 🌟

About The Project 🐥
This project is a basic implementation of a kids store written purely in Java. It's designed to be as straightforward and user-friendly as possible. Originally crafted as a school project, I've decided to share it with the world to help others learn Java in the simplest form. 📚

Features 🎪
Simple Data Storage: Data is temporarily stored, making it easy to understand and manage.
MVC Architecture: Organized in a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure for clear separation of concerns.
Terminal-based UI: Run the project in your terminal and navigate through the store with ease.
Pure Java: No complex frameworks or libraries, just plain old Java to keep things simple.
